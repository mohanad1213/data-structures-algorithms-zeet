## Programming language

You may use any programming language however, this repository primarily utilizes C# and Go.

## Algorithems Analysis

## Leedcode

Each chapter includes a dedicated LeetCode section that links to carefully selected problems designed to reinforce and apply the concepts discussed. For a hands‑on warm‑up and to familiarize yourself with the platform, begin with Problem 1 in the “More Problems” section at the end of the page.
